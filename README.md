## General Information
The goal of this project is to forecast a sales time series using classic forecasting and Machine Learning algorithms:
- Statistical tools for time series
- Single, Double and Triple Exponential Smoothing
- ARIMA family: SARIMA
- Decomposition 
- Autocorrelation and Partial Autocorrelation plots
- Stationarity using Dicker-Fuller test
- SARIMA model
- Residuals analysis
- Machine Learning Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- Machine Learning feature creation techniques: time lags, date features, target encoding


## Technologies Used
- Python 3.8.13


## Project Status
Project is: _in_process_ 


## Room for Improvement
There are others ML algorithms like Porphet and LSTM that should be tested
